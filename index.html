                <h2>Chapter 1: The Story of Virile</h2>
                <p>What is Virile? Virile is a older term used to define someone with a traditional masculine-like personalty. Why is
                    this a thing? Well, in today's society, the term "masculine" is being used less and less. This is due to the
                    fact that the term is being used in a negative way. The term "masculine" is being used to describe someone who
                    is sexist, racist, homophobic, and many other negative terms. This is not what the term "masculine" means. The
                    term "masculine" is used to describe someone who is strong, confident, and a leader. This is what Virile is
                    trying to bring back. We want to bring back the term "masculine" to its original meaning. We want to bring
                    back the term "masculine" to describe someone who is strong, confident, and a leader. We want to bring back
                    the term "masculine" to describe someone who is Virile.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2: The Flag</h2>
                <p>How does the flag represent a Virile? The flag is designed with 3 masculine colors: Blue, Black, and Grey. The flag has 2
                    arrows moving forward to show progression into our movement. More and more men everyday are becoming Virile. The 3 stars represent the
                    3 desires of a man: Protect, Provide, and Procreate. The black line piercing through the flag represents how a man should pierce the world with his
                    masculinity. The flag is a symbol of what it means to be a Virile. A Virile honours this flag as it represents true masculinity and their desires</p>

                <h2>Chapter 3: Sexuality and Spirituality</h2>
                <p>How does a Virile think? A Virile is spirituality connected to himself and has full control over his thoughts. A Virile is
                    sexually connected to himself and has full control over his desires. We understand the 2 genders of this world and how they are 
                different from each other yet both very deserving.</p>

            <br><div id="Chapter 4">
                <h2>Chapter 4: Goals</h2>
                <p>A true Virile should always be working towards a big goal or purpose. Something that will allow you to give your fullest
                    gift and penetrate the world with your masculinity. A Virile is always working towards freedom. Financial freedom, time
                    freedom, and location freedom. A Virile is always working towards a goal that will allow him to be free. A Virile is never afraid
                    to stick up for what he believes in
